Here we provied scripts to reproduce the results in the paper "Dynamic programming algorithms for fast and accurate cell lineage tree reconstruction from CRISPR-based lineage tracing data". 

The python scrpits in [B_scripts](B_scripts) are essentially just a "wrapper" or "caller" of those commands we listed in the paper. The data files (e.g., trees) are temporarily available on [Box](https://umd.app.box.com/folder/290092756447?s=hyw8dcn2rp8p49uxhpptg7rrrp4ckev4) until they can be moved to a more permanent location; be sure to read this [README](https://github.com/molloy-lab/star-study/blob/main/B_scripts/README.md). We needed to re-organize the KP-Tracer data files to improve accessibility; the bash scripts used for the reorganization are in this repository and the re-organized files are in [`bio_result.tar.gz`](https://umd.app.box.com/s/hyw8dcn2rp8p49uxhpptg7rrrp4ckev4/file/1688204416617). 

The CSV files as well as scripts for making plots and tables is under the [summary](summary) directory.
