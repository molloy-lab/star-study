Here we provied scripts that helps reproduce the results in the paper "Dynamic programming algorithms for fast and accurate cell lineage tree reconstruction from CRISPR-based lineage tracing data". However, they are essentially just a "wrapper" or "caller" of those commands we listed in the paper. Therefore, to reproduce our results, we also suggest go to the box and check all README files in our results on box.
We make our data avaibale at (box)[https://umd.app.box.com/folder/290092756447?s=hyw8dcn2rp8p49uxhpptg7rrrp4ckev4].
