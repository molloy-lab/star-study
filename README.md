Here we provied scripts to reproduce the results in the paper "Dynamic programming algorithms for fast and accurate cell lineage tree reconstruction from CRISPR-based lineage tracing data". 

The python scrpits in [B_scripts](https://github.com/molloy-lab/star-study/tree/main/B_scripts) are essentially just a "wrapper" or "caller" of those commands we listed in the paper. The data files (e.g., trees) are temporarily available on [Box]((https://umd.app.box.com/folder/290092756447?s=hyw8dcn2rp8p49uxhpptg7rrrp4ckev4)) until they can be moved to a more permanent location; be sure to check all README files on Box. In particular, the KP-Tracer data (trees) can be found in ```bio-result.tar.gz``` on Box. We needed to re-organized these files to improve accessibility; the bash scripts used for the reorganization are in this repository.

The CSV files as well as scripts for making plots and tables is under the [summary](summary) directory.
